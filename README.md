# Project for drawning Sierpinski-Hexagon

### Makers:
* Viivi @laivii
* And a bit help gotten from Ville @Vsimpro

## This is a personal project out of love for Mathematics

This project was to make a code which forms a picture of the Sierpinski Hexagon.
It needs a lot of optimization at it's current state (8.11.22), but it form a nice picture in a manageable time with 10_000 points (coordinates).

It forms by taking a random corner of the hexagon and then assigning a point in the 2/3 of the distance between the starting and end point.
The Idea is that even though the points form in random order, the picture forms always the same way.

## Here is one picture made with this code

This picture has 10.000 point drawn.
